Żałuję jedynie, że została wydana w tak skromnym, akademickim nakładzie. Polska zdecydowanie cierpi na niedobór luksemburgizmu. <br/><br/>Katarzyna Gelles w sposób wnikliwy i kompleksowy przybliża polskiemu czytelnikowi postać Róży Luksemburg, nie tracąc, mimo naukowego charakteru książki, nic ze swojej przystępności. Autorka skutecznie podkreśla, że chociaż we własnej ojczyźnie zapomniana, Róża pozostaje jedną z najważniejszych postaci Niemieckiego ruchu robotniczego, jeśli nie lewicy w ogóle. <br/><br/>Chociaż ta praca nie skupia się stricte na filozoficznym, politycznym ani ekonomicznym aspekcie działalności Róży Luksemburg, to dostarcza nam minimalną ilość teorii, bez której historii tej wyjątkowej kobiety nie dałoby się przedstawić. Dodatkowo, sposób w jaki autorka rysuje charakterystykę epoki, wraz z różnymi jej aspektami od ruchów narodowych do feminizmu, jest absolutnie wciągający.<br/><br/>Oprócz opisu naukowej i politycznej działalności Róży, czytelnik dostaje również wgląd w jej życie intymne, co chociaż jest najbardziej podatne na interpretacje podglądacza, to zdecydowanie dodaje odmalowanemu portretowi dodatkowej głębi (czy jak kto woli, pikanterii).  <br/><br/>W końcu, praca Gelles wyróżnia się postawieniem akcentu na związki tytułowej bohaterki ze swoją ojczyzną. Szczegółowo zostają przedstawione jej trudne związki z polskimi socjalistami, szczere, ale zawiłe uczucia do Polski, czy powody, dla których wymazano ją ze szkolnych (i nie tylko!) podręczników historii.  <br/><br/>Jako książka, która ma za zadanie wprowadzić polskiego czytelnika w życiorys tej postaci, nie mogę jej nic zarzucić. Z jednej strony autorka zadośćuczyniła akademickiemu rygorowi, a z drugiej stworzyła opowieść, która może przybliżyć postać Róży Luksemburg jej własnym rodakom oraz zainspirować nowe pokolenia do ich własnej próby poprawy świata. W końcu to Polka, której skala osiągnięć może się spokojnie mierzyć z życiorysem naszej ukochanej Marii Skłodowskiej-Curie.",,,1,0
54666,What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America,Thomas  Frank,"Frank, Thomas",,"=""080507774X""","=""9780805077742""",3,3.85,Metropolitan Books,Paperback,332,2005,2004,2024/08/25,2024/08/15,,,read,"In “What’s the Matter with Kansas,” Thomas Frank challenges the bicolor map of the United States beloved by political commentators. Unlike most journalists, he does not take the map's authenticity for granted. Instead, Frank investigates how the association between Republican conservatism and much of the central American states became so prominent in public debate. He chooses Kansas as the patient zero of the new right-wing conservatism epidemic, which he calls *backlash*. Through the lens of cities such as Topeka or Wichita, Frank uncovers the biggest paradox of backlash: how the rebellious working class is digging its own grave and making the hated capitalists happy. Although the book is quite old now, it seems more relevant than ever. Most of the time, I was able to easily adapt his analysis to modern-day Trump’s America.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the author explains how the Kansas workers’ discontent was always rooted in class struggle, which, at the start of the 20th century, led to massive support for progressive policies and labor unions. Then, throughout the book, he provides convincing and elaborate examples of how Republican capitalists transformed this anger into a force against liberal political movements, replacing the logic of class struggle with Culture War. The ways of radicalizing and confusing common people form the central theme of his work.  <br/><br/>There's one particular subject that remains unclear to me. Typically, when someone examines a social phenomenon that clearly benefits the rich, it's assumed that this advantage was achieved, at least partially, through modes of communication owned by capitalists. Thus, it seems unjust to 1. assume that all and only working-class people fall for this, and 2. blame them for being manipulated. Sometimes I feel that Frank understands this, but on the next page I sense his frustration that they are so ""stupid"" to believe it. In other words, he fails to create a compassionate psychological portrait of a person who falls for the backlash logic.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the author provides his readers with many details. Throughout the book, we find accounts of real court cases, politicians, articles, and legislation resolving around Kansas. It’s only through the lens of one state that he could be so precise. Moreover, while writing this book, Frank interviewed many people directly representing backlash ideology. On top of that, “What’s the matter with Kansas” is filled with his personal experience from growing up in the state. While such attention to detail is much appreciated, it my confuse a reader (like me) who is not that familiar with the American reality. For Europeans, Frank’s Kansas bears the peculiarity of an oriental world, even if they experience a similar surge of far-right conservative. <br/><br/>What strikes me, however, is the absence of the other side of the political spectrum. Even if he mentions Democrats, they’re deprived of agency, as if he didn’t want to notice their neglect of the needs of working-class people. Furthermore, he ignores the fact that many Democrats also favor capital. Such bias is a problem of the American political system in general rather than of a single political entity. Sometimes I had a feeling that this book is Frank's personal vendetta aimed at certain people who tried to tear up his home state. On the other hand, the author offers a quite broad perspective. Apart from the direct aspect of backlash, he also discusses its less clear connotations like the involvement of the Catholic Church or racism.<br/><br/>What I've told you by now is my most favorable approximation of what Thomas Frank really meant. As I might have signaled before, his work is confusing at times, especially when the reader tries to draw general conclusions. In my opinion, while he thoroughly explains the mechanism behind the expansion of backlash ideology, he fails to unravel its initial rise to power. He also does not portray the devices used by the rich to achieve such conditions. It seems that Frank assumes that the conservative wing was always there and rich people were lucky enough to benefit from its undertaking. Put another way, although the author points at class struggle, he did not trace the money and power flow that fueled it.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding, in the era of Trump's rise to power, radical events such as the Capitol attack, and upcoming presidential elections, Thomas Frank's insights are still very relevant, as the current state of US affairs is the natural extension of problems described in his study. Despite its many flaws, ""What's the Matter with Kansas"" is a book still worth reading. I just didn't enjoy it that much.",,,1,0

Let’s just say it’s not my cup of tea, as I usually tend to deal with different kinds of literature. However, I have to admit that this novel kept me entertained for over a week.<br/><br/>It’s no wonder Arthur Conan Doyle is considered a master of detective fiction. I love his attention to detail and the way every puzzle has its designated place – a Chekhov's gun brought to perfection. While the story strongly relies on the element of surprise, the author leaves tiny clues (which I mostly overlooked) that are thoroughly explained at the end.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the Sherlock Holmes we encounter in the novel, while still immensely intelligent, is not the god-like figure that the TV show (which I genuinely enjoy) makes him out to be. His strength lies in his refusal to give up after every dead end he encounters. On the other hand, I never expected the original Holmes to be quite such an asshole – a characteristic that definitely adds depth to his quirky nature.<br/><br/>Another great device used by the author was to keep Sherlock out of Dartmoor and focus instead on Dr. Watson’s adventures. While Sherlock, with his cleverness, would have quickly spoiled the mystery, joining the much more likable and relatable Dr. Watson makes the story far more dramatic.<br/><br/>Let me just sum up with the word that I think best describes the book: Brilliant!",,,1,0

Yes, the Thai soup. Just hear me out…<br/>It’s like when you find yourself in a local Thai restaurant for the very first time, and, coerced by kitsch oriental decorations and an unintelligible series of letters on the menu, you decide to point at the name with two surprisingly English-looking words: tom yum.<br/>It’s your tiny revolution. After all, it is not something people in your culture usually have. But the moment you take the first sip (be careful, it’s hot!), a new quality comes into your life. There are good odds it may convince you to keep trying new things.<br/>But now it’s a distant memory. You’re not yet a culinary critic, but you have eaten through a few culinary guides. Today you just want to cook something by yourself. Tom yum is an obvious choice - it’s bearable and easy (as long as you use store-bought gochujang paste). What used to sound extravagant has become your comfort food, and nowadays you tend to search for more elaborate tastes in restaurants.<br/>Nonetheless, you still love it. And it was good to remind yourself about it.<br/><br/>Now, if you’re not convinced by this food allegory (which, by the way, I think is an amazing tool to describe first impressions of things), here is my more detailed view on Edible Economics.<br/><br/>Let’s start with the obvious: despite the title, this work discusses much more than just economics (or food). Among the explored topics are, for example, the history of violence, foreign affairs, and social justice. Now, do not expect Ha-Joon Chang to be politically impartial as he has a clear agenda (in my opinion a very honorable one as he tries to cure the neoliberal epidemic). He explains it with undeniable sincerity and clarity. And what’s more important, he proves how much economics intersects with both politics and everyday life.<br/>To make things easy, I will list all I really endorsed about this work first, then I will complain a little.<br/>The book is immensely fun. Although the main interest here is economics, all facts and stories about food would be interesting enough to read on their own. Moreover, the way in which he connects those two worlds is inspiring and proves him to be an excellent writer.<br/>In terms of content, Ha-Joon Chang provides many persuasive historical examples, especially for his arguments for protectionism. Besides, he also touches upon interesting topics that are often overlooked in mainstream introductions to economics, e.g., patent laws. Finally, he offers a broader perspective on countries outside of the so-called western world. He often undermines the western neoliberal narrative by introducing a post-colonial economic account. Add that it’s a quick read and requires little prior knowledge, and you get an excellent introduction to changing your worldview.<br/><br/>Now, unfortunately, the book has its downsides or at least things that I was expecting to be more present. First and most crucial is that you won’t find any concrete definitions, mathematical formulas, tables, or history of economic thought. This book is built more as a tale than a textbook - it aims to teach by entertaining and entertain by teaching, leaving no room for long, overloaded explanations. As a result, while it may change your worldview, it won’t necessarily prepare you to defend your position against people experienced in the field.<br/>Furthermore, despite my generally positive opinion on the book’s content, I think it is far from perfect. Some points seem a little vague, and a few topics lacked good reasoning. Although I previously stated that it does not require prior knowledge, occasionally, I felt the author sounded convincing only because I was already inclined to a similar stance. As I mentioned, it is a good starting point, though I craved a more elaborated work.<br/><br/>But overall, I had a great time reading this. Some subjects really opened my eyes; sometimes, I wanted to know more. Some things even left me slightly irritated. However, I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who either starts an interest in economics or just wants to know more about the current state of the world.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

It tells the story of youthful men’s struggle to exist (both philosophically and physically) throughout the horrors of the World War I trenches. By means of graphic imagery and the protagonist' contemplations, Remarque tries to depict and oppose war in both its bestiality and absurdity. Even Tjaden, one of his most naive characters, understands its preposterousness, yet war is still waged in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Predominantly, the book’s narrative fits many other writings of the Lost Generation, depicting the sterilization of young men of human feelings. War at first turns them into killing machines, then leaves them alone to cope with a new reality they do not understand:<br/><blockquote><br/>“We are forlorn like children, and experienced like old men, we are crude and sorrowful and superficial - I believe we are lost.”<br/></blockquote><br/>But in the dread of war, not only humanity is lost. Our understanding of the world is shattered, literature included. What more can you write after experiencing all this horror? It is difficult to look the living in the eyes when you’re still haunted by the dead. This deconstruction (not in the Derridean sense) of the literary world of Remarque can also be seen in his style.<br/><br/>Many times, especially in the beginning, I felt disoriented by the inconsistency of the language. Sometimes it was elevated, other times bluntly simple. Later I found that it mirrors the context of the situations. While depictions of nature or internal feelings were written in this exalted tone, scenes of combat or death were deprived of any subtlety. Through such devices, Remarque plays with the language, imposing onto reader a sinusoidal perception of the world. While the first mode of telling a story still lacks some finesse, it may reflect the common roots of the main protagonist.<br/><br/>What Remarque tells about is not just the experience of his and a few other people. It is the experience of the whole generation, who were dragged into the conflict by 20th-century politicians and ideologists.<br/><blockquote><br/>“I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. I see how peoples are set against one another, and in silence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one another. I see that the keenest brains of the world invent weapons and words to make it yet more refined and enduring. And all men of my age, here and over there, throughout the whole world see these things; all my generation is experiencing these things with me. […] Our knowledge of life is limited to death. What will happen afterwards? And what shall come out of us?”<br/></blockquote><br/>And to this day, in all corners of the world, new lost generations of people emerge. Practically every day since then, young men and women die in the name of ideas and disputes they should not even care about. This is precisely why this book is still relevant. Let me leave you with a quote that, in my opinion, shows the grotesque nature of war best:<br/><blockquote><br/>“Bertinck has a chest wound. After a while a fragment smashes away his chin, and the same fragment has sufficient force to tear open Leer’s hip. Leer groans as he supports himself on his arm, he bleeds quickly, no one can help him. Like an emptying tube, after a couple of minutes, he collapses. What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician at school.”<br/></blockquote>",,,1,0

And he does a great job.<br/><br/>In this book, Orwell, witty as always, decided to join two divergent approaches to comment on the same topic. The first part is a report on the life conditions, work, and unemployment of British coal miners in Wigan, Northern England. The image that he puts together is disturbing and thought-provoking, especially now, when we start to forget that the problem still exists. On top of that, he does not hesitate to drop some interesting and valuable sociological ideas. I wrote this before, but I will repeat it once more: Orwell is a great observer of ordinary life and an excellent writer.<br/><br/>The second part takes the form of an essay that mostly focuses on the critique of the socialist movement and its prevalent pretentiousness and superficiality, from a wholeheartedly socialist stance. While sometimes I had the feeling that some parts were unconvincing and motivated by his anger, other insights he provided are exceptionally innovative for the time. But mind this: Orwell probably hates your guts.<br/><br/>All leftists must read!",,,1,0

But maybe you will find, in this rather short work, a great deal of insights and value as I did.<br/><br/>For most of the book, not much is happening. Orwell focuses on presenting a sincere historical account - he shares his thoughts on the realities of war, the plethora of political movements in Spain, and the psychology of men-at-arms. It seems that he tries to be as objective as he can (culminating in his statement that he cannot be unbiased), which nicely intertwines with his critique of mainstream journalism.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, what makes Orwell so exceptional are his observations of everyday life. He manages to make things that may seem trivial to others, a fascinating phenomenon.<br/><br/>On top of that, Orwell's narration remains surprisingly funny, considering that many moments had to be extremely traumatic and painful. Not to mention his elegant yet very light writing style.<br/><br/>There is one angle from which Homage to Catalonia may be very exciting for those interested in literary studies. It’s hard not to see the effect that time spent in Catalonia had on Orwell, and how it influenced his most widely known book - 1984. It’s very stimulating to find some excerpts from one book and fit them into the context of another.<br/><br/>Finally, it's significant that he wrote this memoir just after he had returned from Spain in 1938. This means that he did not know at the time that the fascists would win nor the upcoming horrors of the Second World War. You may find much interesting information comparing his biography (Wikipedia will suffice) to what he believed at the time.<br/><br/>Although I don’t see him as a great theoretician of politics, socialism, or social movements, his sensitivity allowed him to capture the gloomy mood of Europe in 1938. And this mood is increasingly possible to notice today.<br/><br/>“...all sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.”<br/><br/>Overall, it may not change your life, but it’s a truly pleasant read.",,,1,0

To this day (and I read it almost a month ago), I’m still not sure if I agree with the author. It’s surprising how many notes I made for this book and how often I find myself thinking about it. This is the main power of this book: it stays in your head. “Chasing the Scream” is not just about drugs; it’s about power, corruption, and discrimination.Before delving into the core of its content, let’s discuss the technical aspects; the way it was written.<br/><br/>The amount of work Hari has put into this book deserves applause. The number of sources, the variety of people he met, the transparency, and the fact that he traveled around the world to complete this project is commendable.<br/><br/>The book’s structure is both clear and diverse. We journey through historical tales, personal stories, and into more political and scientific accounts, all nicely tied together.<br/><br/>What struck me at first, and lasted to the end, was how intimate the topic was for the author. I’m used to more impartial non-fiction writings, but I quickly started to share the author’s commitment to the subject. Especially when I started empathizing with all the characters in the book, as Hari lets them tell us their own, sometimes very brutal and miserable stories from war fronts. Giving a voice to the voiceless is, for me, the essence of good literature.<br/><br/>One thing I struggled with the most was how often Hari says, “Trust me, man, I couldn’t believe it myself, but it’s true”. I get it – it’s probably sincere – he shares with us his own struggle with understanding truths that you and everyone else were taught to be completely opposite. There is great value in that. I see myself trying to convince my friends that something is different than we thought. Nonetheless, I was raised to follow the principle of limited trust, and sometimes he was just too much.<br/><br/>Regarding the topic itself, for most of the time, I kept a certain level of doubt about what Hari was saying. He just seemed slightly too optimistic, though I must admit he addressed many uncertainties, sharing his own doubts. Nevertheless, I did some research myself and found that some conclusions are not so evident. For example, Portugal’s statistics are not clear-cut (neither for nor against). Moreover, now we have almost ten more years of experience to verify some theories – for example, the lack of distinct drug use growth during the COVID pandemic may undermine some of them.<br/><br/>But it is not for clear and flawless argumentation that I find this book so critical. Instead, it’s the uneasy questions it asks, which make you wonder whether the world should look different. Hari proves that the discussion on the topic is needed, and that fact angers me whenever I see the lack of any debate on the problem in my country. Politics like to think that the world is simple and that drugs are just bad.<br/><br/>Lastly, when I was at the very end of the book, I read about the author’s skeleton in the cupboard. I think that everyone should judge it for themselves. I, for example, conducted a quick fact-check which soothed my discontent.<br/><br/>Finally, I disagree with Hari on one thing. I believe that the war on drugs is not yet over. It’s just starting to change.",,,1,0

Previously, I knew O’Brien from his short stories, where his predilection for absurdity and ludicrousness did not divert my attention from the important motifs and ideas. However, shortly after the promising and catchy beginning of 'The Third Policeman,' I found myself completely lost. I could not focus on any literary theme for examination. For someone who loves a critical approach to reading, this was particularly frustrating. Yet, I didn’t give up.<br/><br/>Before delving into a brief analysis of the motifs in the book, I want to mention the aspects that kept me reading despite the seemingly pointless experience. Generally, I don’t despise some level of absurdity. Quite the contrary, I appreciated O’Brien’s approach to metafiction in analyzing de Selby. It was not only extremely funny but also an innovative way to depict the state of science (be it modern or Victorian, I'm unsure). Another feature that allowed me to settle into the narrative was the delightful and clever depictions of the Irish countryside.<br/><br/>As for the motifs that I believe O’Brien elaborated on in his novel (feel free to disagree):<br/>* Man versus bureaucracy<br/>* The contrast with (or fusion of) modern science and the Irish countryside<br/>* Crime and punishment<br/>I don’t feel the need to elaborate further, nor am I sure I could. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I must admit that the action picked up in the last two chapters, clarifying the main premise of this book. And although I felt lost for most of the book, by the end, my initial interpretations of the plot’s meaning aligned with the actual story.<br/>The ending tied up the entire plot neatly, and I couldn't resist feeling that 'The Third Policeman' shares some similarities with Kafka’s [b:The Trial|17690|The Trial|Franz Kafka|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320399438l/17690._SY75_.jpg|2965832]—though with a less depressed author.<br/>And that’s mainly it. I’m not sure if I will ever read this book again, but I will almost certainly read another book by this author. <br/>In the end, I am left with one thought: only in Ireland could all this have happened.<br/>",,,1,0

The story of the Sackler family's greed and cynicism—or their detachment from reality—is simply outrageous, shocking, unbelievable, and sometimes surreal, especially for an European who has not firsthand experienced the opioid crisis. The story speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I will try to highlight the most impressive aspects of Keefe’s work.<br/>First is the praise for the author's astonishing effort in gathering all the evidence, sources, and information for a story that begins over 100 years ago. For people who do not want to take his words or his already established reputation for granted, there are almost 100 pages of references and a chapter dedicated to the whole process.<br/><br/>Another feature worth mentioning is the perspective Keefe adopted. Although he dedicates a lot of space in the book to those topics, it is not the perspective of over two decades of the opioid epidemic nor the last few years of legal wars between the state and Purdue Pharma. Instead, Keefe tells a cohesive story of three generations of the Sackler family, wrapping their (too kind) doom within a cause-and-effect relationship. At one point, I could not resist the resemblance of the narrative to Gabriel García Márquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.<br/><br/>Finally, it's unbelievable how universal this book is. The tale about the Sackler family is but an excuse to exhibit how the American system of justice fails to protect its citizens from the greed of rich corporations. ‚The Empire of Pain' explores the darkest aspects of marketing and capitalism in general and shows that in the 21st century, no power or authority is greater than that of corporate money.<br/>Although reading this book is immensely beneficial and important, to some extent it can be summed up with one of the old truths about the world: the rich are getting richer.<br/>",,,1,0
